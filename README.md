# Orchard-Frontend-Test

## Technology used
- React: My favourite Javascript library that I have used the most 
- Create-react-app: the best way for creating a single page application with webpack and babel configured for us
- React router: to navigate between pages
- Boostrap: to make styling easier (for flex and grid component), helped me creating modal by utilising modal css
