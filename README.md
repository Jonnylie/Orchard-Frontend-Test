# Orchard-Frontend-Test

## Technology used
- React: It is the library that I like and have used the most 
- Create-react-app: the best way for creating a single page application with webpack and babel configured for us
- React router: to navigate between pages
- Boostrap: to make styling easier, helped me creating modal by utilising modal css and this project used display grid and flex many times so using bootstrap is very helpful here
