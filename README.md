# Interface Development Test

## Design assets

- Invision public URL: https://invis.io/7R1299R6C2WT
- Invision password: orchard123
- If you require access please email your contact to arrange.
  _I have sent a request, send email to orchard to give you access_

## Test instructions

In the linked Invision page you will find the designs for two components. Complete the following:
_two component mentioned above_

- The code should be submitted via a github account. Bonus points for more than one commit.
  _commit more with meaningful comments_
- Build the two blocks using modern HTML5 standards.
  _two component, semantic html (watch webdevsimplified intro to html)_
- Use JavaScript to capture all anchor clicks, and `console.log()` the element which has been clicked.
  _capture <a> tag, console.log('summer lunch menu by Mark Best' article has been clicked)_
- As with any modern web-build we expect a level of interactivity/animation to be displayed on the nodes.
  _interactivity/animation, display picture in modal if picture is click_
- All content areas should be deemed as being populated from a CMS - so all copy lengths can vary!
  _display long text with ..._

## Technologies

- Any CSS-preprocessors or frameworks.
  _bootstrap, sass, react, react router, create react app?_
- ES5 or ES6+ acceptable.
  _ES6_
- Please include some reasoning for the decisions via comments or readme.
  _reasons why you choose the technology in readme_
- Build tools and task runners are encouraged (e.g. grunt/gulp/webpack).
  _create react app to make it simpler_

## Layout

- The layout is expected to work in the latest Chrome/FireFox/Edge versions.
- The layout should be responsive and work down to a `320px` mobile device.
  _responsive using bootstrap 5_
- Bearing in mind that this application is expected to be responsive, the developer should consider the appropriate `<meta>` tags.
  _i am not sure about this, ask Yoga maybe or do some research on google_
- **Section: All the latest:** These items should be links to new pages.
- **Section: Answer your body's needs:** Each image in this section should display in a modal on click.

## Review Criteria

We are looking for your ability to bring life to static designs. During that process consider the following:
_make it a modern website with some interactivity/animation_

- **Project structure:** Clean project and logical traversal.
  _logical traversal, project and code must be clean_
- **JavaScript:** Efficiency of code and efficacy in bringing the design to life.
- **Interface:** Semantic markup styling.
  _semantic html_
- **Git:** Bonus points for submission on a github account showing multiple commits.
  _multiple commits on github is a must_
- **Quality:** Production-grade build and precision.
  _quality must be great and please make sure all comments above are addressed_
